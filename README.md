# Create a volcano plot
The purpose of this program was to create a volcano plot from expression data. Further, points are colored red if their fold-change is larger than 10 (up or down) and their -log10(p-value) is above 8.

Points are labeled with their gene name if their fold-change is larger than 10 (only down) and their -log10(p-value) is greater than 30.
